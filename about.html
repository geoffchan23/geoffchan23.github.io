        <p>Hey, I'm Geoff. For the past 6 years I've ran a small dev agency called <a href="https://stackfive.io">Stack Five</a> based out of Toronto. Previously I've been a director of engineering, software engineer, and frontend developer lead.</p>
        <p>I love learning cutting edge tech and helping people to solve real-world business challenges efficiently and effectively.</p>
