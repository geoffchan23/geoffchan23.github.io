        <h3>About This Project</h3>
        <p>I've loved comics since I was a kid. I always wanted to create a webcomic, but I've never really gotten serious about doing it. When AI image generation models came out, like the Dall-E series and Midjourney, the first thing I tried was creating comics with them. Unfortunately, they were bad at generating text in images. But then <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-4o-image-generation/" target="_blank">4o Image Generation launched</a> and we finally got <em>really good</em> text in images.</p>
        <p>The idea of the Comic Factory was to create a full autonomous daily comic. Admittedly, the first version is only semi-autonomous because 4o image gen isn't avaiable via API yet. However, I'm quite happy that I was able to get it pretty close.</p>
